<h1>
	Introduction to the Nutrient Priorities Website
</h1>
<p>
	This website provides supporting evidence for a study looking into the effects by 2030 of increasing productivity of selected crops in selected countries by 25 percent over the present rate of increase. This results in a biological increase of about 4 percent between 2015 and 2030.</p>
	<p>The website provides detailed, country-specific information on affordability, food and nutrient availability by food group and adequacy and dietary diversity for scenarios to 2050, with results reported for 2030 and 2050. The scenarios are based on </p>
	<ul>
	<li>The Shared Socioeconomic Profiles SSP2 pathway, often considered to be middle of the road or business as usual. </li>
	<li>Climate change effects on yields driven the most extreme (RCP 8.5) of the IPCC climate scenarios, as realized in the Hadley climate model, HGEM.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The crops are banana, barley, beans, cassava, chickpea, cowpea, groundnuts, lentils, maize, millet, other pulses, pigeonpea, plantain, potato, rice, sorghum, soybean, sweet potato, wheat, and yam.</p>
	<p>The scenarios use a naming convention of:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>SSP2 - the scenario name</li>
	  <li>HGEM - the abbreviatio for  the climate model used</li>
	  <li>-x - where x is a 5 digit code for a crop (e.g., cchkp is chickpea) or cf for results without any productivity increase</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	The website has a tabbed interface; one tab for each topic with sub-tabs to provide detail.
