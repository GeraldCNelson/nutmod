<p>The Shannon diversity index (SD) based on mass of food consumed from different sources:</p>
<p><img src="ShanDiv.png" alt="Shannon Diversity Index" width="100" height="25" /></p>
<p>where <em>s</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> is the share (by mass) of the i<sup>th</sup> food item of the 61 available in IMPACT. If consumption of an item is zero then its contribution to the index is set to zero.</p>
<p>When all foods are available in equal amounts, the index is equal to ln(<em>N</em>), where <em>N</em> is the total number of foods considered. The more unequal the distribution, the smaller the indicator value. SDNorm is the normalized version of SD (SD *100/ln(<em>N)</em> where 100 is equal consumption of all food items and 0 is consumption of only 1 food item.</p>
