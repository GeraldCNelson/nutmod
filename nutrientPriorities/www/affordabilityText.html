<p>Productivity increases can change both family income and food prices. Average expenditure as a share of per capita income can show how much of a difference the productivity increase makes to affordability.</p>
<p>Average expenditure on an individual commodity is its consumer price times the quantity available to the average consumer. Summing across all commodities gives total expenditure on modelled food items. The share of food expenditure in per capita income is an indicator of the affordability of the diet.</p>
<p>The table below reports values for three items&mdash;annual per capita food expenditures and income (1000 purchasing power dollars) and the share of per capita income spent on food (percent). Expenditures of fish and alcoholic beverages are not included here so the share is understated. These items are reported for 2010, 2030 and 2050.</p>
