<p>Note:</p>
<p>Nutrient requirements are based on  age and gender, and in the case of women whether pregnant or lactating. The  availability data are for the average consumer (total availability divided by total population). The population data set used does include age and gender.</p>
<p>The requirements used in this tab are for a representative consumer, weighting each age and gender group by its population. Hence the requirements change over time as the demographics of the population also change.</p>
<p>The population data set does not include the number of pregnant and lactating women so these were estimated by assuming that each category is 20 percent of the number of children in the age group 0 to 4.</p>
<p>Nutrient requirements were taken from Dietary Reference Intake reports at  <a href="http://www.nap.edu">www.nap.edu</a>. All requirements except those for vitamin K and potassium are recommended daily allowances.</p>
<p>In the kilocalorie bar charts, the 'other' category is the residual of total energy minus energy from the three macronutrients&mdash;protein, carbohydrates, and fat. </p>
