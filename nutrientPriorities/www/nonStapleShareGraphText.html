<p>Nutrients sourced from non-staples are likely to be accompanied by more diverse availability of other needed nutrients.</p>
<p>This tab shows the share of non-staples in total dietary energy. This metric is a useful simple indicator of diet diversity. A greater proportion of energy available from non-staples typically indicates dietary patterns with higher consumption of nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits and animal-sourced foods. This metric of dietary diversity is most relevant in lower-income countries which have a low share of energy from non-staples.</p>
