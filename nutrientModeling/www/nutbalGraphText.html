<p>Nutritionists consider diversity of food consumption an important component of a healthy diet. Elements of diversity include diversity of food intake within a day, across several days, for the average diet. And it includes diversity of individual food items as well as from food groups and staples and non-staples.</p>
<p>This tab shows the nutrient balance (NB) score. It captures nutritional adequacy across the range of qualifying nutrients. It uses adjusted adequacy ratios, where the maximum value for each ratio is set to one. It is the sum of the adjusted adequacy ratios divided by the total number of nutrients. A diet that includes all qualifying nutrients in sufficient amounts has an NB of 100. </p>
