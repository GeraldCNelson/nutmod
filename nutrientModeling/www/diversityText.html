<h1>Modeling dietary diversity, Shannon diversity Index</h1>
<p>Diversity of food consumption is an important component of a healthy diet. Elements of diversity include diversity of food intake within a day, across several days, and for the average diet. And it includes diversity of individual food items as well as from food groups and staples and non-staples. The data available for this analysis only allows for selected diversity measures.</p>
<h2>Nonstaple share of kilocalories</h2>
<p>The share of kilocalories available from non-staples is a useful simple indicator of diet quality. A greater proportion of energy available from non-staples typically indicates dietary patterns with higher consumption of nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits and animal-sourced foods. This metric of dietary quality is most relevant in lower income countries. Once the share of dietary energy from non-staples if greater than 60 percent, other indicators of dietary quality are needed.</p>
<h2>Rao’s quadratic entropy metric</h2>
<p>Rao’s quadratic entropy metric captures the nutrient diversity of food availability more directly by comparing nutrient composition of all foods in pairs, using a Euclidean distance measure and then weighting their contributions by the product of the share of the pairs in total food availability</p>

<p>where <em>d</em><em><sub>ij</sub></em> is the Euclidean distance between food items <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> of the S = 61 available in IMPACT.</p>

<p>where <em>p</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> is the share of the i<sup>th</sup> food item in the total weight of daily food availability and N is the number of nutrients being considered.
<h1>Nutrient Balance Concept</h1>
<p>The Nutrient Balance Concept is a new approach to nutrient profiling of foods, meals, and diets. Nutrient profile models distinguish between qualifying (required for good health) and disqualifying (harmful in excess) nutrients. Individual foods, meals, and diets can, and often do, contain both types so a focus on just one type of nutrient can provide a misleading picture of the overall benefits of an individual food, a meal or a diet.</p>
