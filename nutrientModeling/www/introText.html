	Introduction to the Nutrient Modeling Website
</h1>
<p>
	This website presents detailed, country-specific information on affordability, food and nutrient availability by food group and adequacy and dietary diversity for scenarios to 2050.
</p>
<p>
	It is based on research by a group of collaborators (see Acknowledgements section) to be published in two papers&mdash;one substantive and one technical that includes the code and data. The tentative titles are
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Potential income growth and climate change effects on global nutrition security to mid-century
	</li>
	<li>
		Modeling nutrition security scenarios: Description of the technical process
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The website, and the results, are currently in development, and these tabs are likely to vary with each visit. Please treat this as work-in-progress and do not share. If you find something that seems wrong or is questionable, please see the "For Further Information" tab.
</p>
<p>
	The website has a tabbed interface; one tab for each topic with sub-tabs to provide detail.
</p>
