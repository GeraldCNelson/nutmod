<h1>
	Introduction to the Nutrient Modeling Website
</h1>
<p>This website accompanies the paper <u>Income growth and climate change effects on global nutrition security to mid-century</u> (currently under review) and should be viewed in conjunction with that paper (coauthors are listed in the Acknowledgements tab). It presents detailed, country-specific information on affordability, food and nutrient availability by food group and adequacy and dietary diversity for scenarios to 2050.
</p>
<p>
	The website, and the results, are currently in development. Please treat this as work-in-progress and do not share. If you find something that seems wrong or is questionable, please send us a note to  the "For Further Information" tab.
</p>
<p>
	The website has a tabbed interface; one tab for each topic with sub-tabs to provide detail.
