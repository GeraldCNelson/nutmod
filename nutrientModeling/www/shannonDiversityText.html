<h1>Dietary diversity: Shannon diversity index</h1>
<p>Draft, 5/27/17</p>
<p>Consuming a diverse diet, both in terms of food groups, and individual food items within food groups, is important for consuming the variety of nutrients needed in sufficient quantities for good health. Elements of diversity include diversity of food intake within a day, across several days, for the average diet. And it includes diversity of individual food items as well as from food groups and staples and non-staples. The data available for this analysis only allows for selected diversity measures.</p>
<p>The Shannon diversity index (SD) based on mass of food consumed from different sources:</p>

<p>where <em>s</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> is the share (by mass) of the i<sup>th</sup> food item of the 61 available in IMPACT. If consumption of an item is zero then its contribution to the index is set to zero.</p>
<p>When all foods are available in equal amounts, the index is equal to ln(<em>N</em>), where <em>N</em> is the total number of foods considered. The more unequal the distribution, the smaller the indicator value. SDNorm is the normalized version of SD (SD *100/ln(<em>N)</em> where 100 is equal consumption of all food items and 0 is consumption of only 1 food item.</p>
