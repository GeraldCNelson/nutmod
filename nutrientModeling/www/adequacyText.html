  <p>The human body needs many essential nutrients from the diet. On the other hand, some nutrients have negative health effects if consumed in excess. Nutrient needs for good health are collectively called Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) measures. Nutrients with negative health consequences when consumed in excess are called disqualifying nutrients.</p>
<p>This tab presents adequacy ratios&mdash;the ratio of average daily availability of a beneficial nutrient to the requirement for a representative consumer. This analysis uses the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) or the Adequate Intake (AI) for nutrients that do not have an RDA (fiber and potassium for all population groups; all nutrients for infants aged 0-6 months; all nutrients for infants 6-12 months except protein, iron and zinc for which an RDA is available). Since RDA and AI values are by age group and gender, the adequacy ratio uses an average value weighted by the share of the age and gender group in total population. Since the population groups change in composition over time, the requirements for a representative consumer do so as well.</p>
<p>The radar graphs below can be resized by making the web page larger. Each of the four graphs shows the adequacy ratios for the nutrients arrayed around the circle. The legend to the left of the graphs shows the values for each of the rings in the graph. The closer to the center, the smaller the adequacy ratio for that nutrient. The legend at the bottom of the four graphs shows the colors for the three years represented - 2010, 2030, and 2050.</p>
<p>This page also includes results for the quantity and share of total energy from carbohydrates, protein, sugar, and fat. The radio buttons to the left of the bar charts change the scenario for which these data are displayed.</p>
<p>Data for all the graphs on this page are displayed at the bottom of the page and can be downloaded from the side panel.</p>
