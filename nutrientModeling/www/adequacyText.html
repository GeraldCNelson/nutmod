<p>The human body needs many essential nutrients from the diet, shortages of which have negative health consequences. On the other hand, some nutrients have negative health effects if consumed in excess. Nutrient needs for good health are collectively called Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) measures. Nutrients with negative health consequences when consumed in excess are called disqualifying nutrients.</p>
<p>This tab presents adequacy ratios&mdash;the ratio of average daily availability of a beneficial nutrient to the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) or the Adequate Intake (AI) for nutrients that do not have an RDA (fiber and potassium for all population groups; all nutrients for infants aged 0-6 months; all nutrients for infants 6-12 months except protein, iron and zinc for which an RDA is available). Since RDA and AI values are by age group and gender, the adequacy ratio uses an average value weighted by the share of the age and gender group in total population. Since the population groups change in composition over time, the RDAs do so as well.</p>
<p>It also includes results for the quantity and share of total energy from carbohydrates, protein, sugar, and fat.</p>
