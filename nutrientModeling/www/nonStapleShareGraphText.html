<h1>Dietary diversity: nonstaple share of dietary energy</h1>
<p>Draft, 8/18/17</p>
<p>Nutritionists consider diversity of food consumption an important component of a healthy diet. Elements of diversity include diversity of food intake within a day, across several days, for the average diet. And it includes diversity of individual food items as well as from food groups and staples and non-staples.</p>
<p>Nutrients sourced from non-staples are likely to be accompanied by more diverse availability of other needed nutrients.</p>
<p>This tab shows the share of non-staples in total dietary energy. This metric is a useful simple indicator of diet diversity. A greater proportion of energy available from non-staples typically indicates dietary patterns with higher consumption of nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits and animal-sourced foods. This metric of dietary diversity is most relevant in lower-income countries which have a low share of energy from non-staples.</p>
