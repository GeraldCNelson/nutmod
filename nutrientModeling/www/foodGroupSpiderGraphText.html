<h1>Dietary diversity: nutrient availability by food group</h1>
<p>Draft, 6/9/17</p>
<p>Diversity of food consumption is considered by nutritionists to be an important component of a healthy diet. Elements of diversity include diversity of food intake within a day, across several days, for the average diet. And it includes diversity of individual food items as well as from food groups and staples and non-staples. The data available for this analysis only allows for selected diversity measures.</p>
<p>Nutrients sourced from different food groups are likely to be accompanied by more diverse availability of other needed nutrients.</p>
<p>This tab presents bar graphs showing the food group sources of nutrients.</p>
