<p>SSP&mdash;Shared Socioeconomic Pathways</p>
<p>SSPs include both qualitative and quantitative elements. For this paper we use per capita GDP and population from three SSPs.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSP1&mdash;A future with faster and more even income growth.</li>
<li>SSP2&mdash;The reference scenario. A future with  middle of the road outcomes.</li>
<li>SSP3&mdash;A future with with slower and more uneven income growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>This research uses three scenarios that combine SSP data with climate data to 2050.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSP1-NoCC&mdash;Population and income data from SSP1 with no effects of climate change on crop productivity.</li>
<li>SSP2-NoCC&mdash;Population and income data from SSP2 with no effects of climate change on crop productivity.</li>
<li>SSP3-NoCC&mdash;Population and income data from SSP3 with no effects of climate change on crop productivity.</li>
<li>SSP2-HGEM&mdash;Population and income data from SSP2 with crop productivity altered by weather data derived from the climate change results from the HadGEM2-ES implementation of CMIP5 centennial simulations using RCP8.5. This combination of climate model and RCP gives the largest negative effects on nutrient availability of the three climate models we have results for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenario names can also end with "REF". This is a placeholder for future scenarios that vary the RCP used.</p>
<p>RCP&mdash;Representative Concentration Pathway</p>
<p>Representative consumer&mdash;Nutrient requirements are based on age and gender, and in the case of women whether pregnant or lactating. The availability data are for the average consumer (total availability divided by total population). The population data set used does include age and gender. The requirements used in this analysis are for a representative consumer, weighting each age and gender group by its population. Hence the requirements for the representative consumer change over time as the demographics of the population also change.</p>
<p>RDA&mdash;Recommended Dietary Allowance. The average intake level of a nutrient that would meet the needs of 97.5 percent of healthy individuals in a group.</p>
<p>AI&mdash; Adequate intake is the recommended average daily nutrient intake level, based on experimentally derived intake levels or approximations of observed mean nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that are assumed to be adequate.</p>
<p>AMDR&mdash;The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is defined as a range of intakes for a particular energy source. An AMDR is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake.</p>
<p>NBC&mdash;The Nutrient Balance Concept (NBC) has been proposed as a measure of overall nutritional quality of foods or meals which distinguishes between qualifying (required for good health) and disqualifying (harmful in excess) nutrients <a href = "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130491">Source.</a></p>
<p>Disqualifying nutrient&mdash;A term from the U.S> Food and Drug Administration in determining permissable health claims. "Disqualifying nutrient levels means the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a food above which the food will be disqualified from making a health claim." <a href = "https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.14">Source.</a></p>
<p>MRV&mdash;Maximum Recommended Intake Value. Some nutrients have negative health consequences if consumed in excess. For this study, three are included&mdash;sugar, total saturated fatty acids, and ethanol. The MRV is the maximum amount that should be consumed of one of these nutrients. For sugar and total saturated fatty acids it is 10 per cent of dietary energy. For ethanol it is 20 grams per day for adults except pregnant and lactating women; zero otherwise.</p>
