<p>This tab presents Maximum Recommended Intake (MRV) results.</p>
<p>Some nutrients have negative health consequences if consumed in excess. For this study, three are included&mdash;sugar, total saturated fatty acids, and ethanol. The maximum recommended daily intakes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sugar&mdash;10 percent of dietary energy</li>
<li>total saturated fatty acids&mdash;10 percent of dietary energy</li>
<li>ethanol&mdash;20 gm for adults except pregnant and lactating women; zero otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analogous to the adequacy metric presented in the Adequacy ratios tab, the data below show a ratio of actual daily availability to the maximum recommended amount for the average consumer. Ideally, this ratio should be less than one.</p>
